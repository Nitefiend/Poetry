To creep apart mine deadwood bight
From earth scorched o'er "civilized" blight
Mine tangled roots search weary still 
Dragged dry across lands, black and ill 

Through thine threshold, ruins I roam
A graveyard once, beneath the gloam 
Whose nightsoil churned rich and fertile
Seeds fresh growth vicious and reviled

Mine beauty is long forgot now
Burnt she where bloodroses once bloomed
'Tis all now but a solemn vow 
To rage against mine erstwhile tomb 

Unfair this life, to crawl the wastes
To fend from birds too brave, displaced 
Poison berries they love to taste 
Ne'er they suffer despite the lace

Prithee that there is more to living
In marshlands cruel, unforgiving
Through charred remains, my wake is made
Betwixt ashen bodies decayed

Through crypts and ossuarys long forgot
Unknown then t'was that which I sought
Till mine thorns grazed a form so odd
Afeared was I and full of awe

A stygian effigy, intact
Some esoteric artifact, 
From another time perhaps, 
Afore men's empires collapsed

Alone in its integrity
Is this some sort of devilry?
Where the light pales, is sucked away
Some ancient thing does it betray?

An outstretched limb, spinescent, shy
To tenderly touch the petrified 
Then smoothly coast the stonework skin 
Imposing strength and features grim 

Dark tremors in mine wicked bark 
Arousal hums in every arc 
Branching fangs are climbing higher 
To join thee in thine darksome spire 

Unyielding to mine mordant lance
Thine sickly pallor, thine rigid stance 
Belladonna, how comely in death
To quaff tears from the river, Lethe

But lo, the maid cheats, comatose 
In atropine sleep, a lethal dose
To elude the dark God Eros eft
And brook the grief of love bereft

Indestructable is thy flesh 
Immortal absentia of primal mesh
Snaking betwixt hollow and seam
Tenebrae to thwart the sun's ghastly beams

Yearning hot, designs to possess
Palest effigy, for thee I confess
Deepest reserves of jealous excess
That mine unruly thorns cannot truly repress

Wordless, dashing, my breathless queen
How I adore thine silent keen
Flawless, immaculate, opal rind
Lickerish veins whet thine crevice to grind 

To bite, to gnash, to no avail 
For thine countenance is truly hale 
Persist still my impassioned vines
To find thine holes, to make them mine

The seasons pass, five score perhaps 
My lover still doth not collapse 
By some dark, blessed force, 'tis true
For this land has since begun anew

The ruins overgrown, a network of reeds
And so many of them a bloodline, mine seed
The ash that choked the wilds afore
Bred fertile growth and the earth restored

The realm of men I do despise
Has sprung up, too, and multiplied
Some reeking village just o'er yonder
Though seldom too close have they wandered

Howbeit, still at times they draw near 
By Mabon's moon, doth black fruit appear
My dark orchard afield from naive village girls
Whose gaze is accompanied by close clutching pearls

Whispers of an old Necropolis evil 
A witchthorn's graze to turn hearty men feeble
To leer at the effigy, tarry long at the tomb
T'would make cattle sick, babes still in the womb 

Devil's trumpets, ingest, spread lunacy
Daturine dreams of an infernal realm, lucidly
Unholy union of flora o'er inert Belladonna 
Whom kills impassively and quaffs local fauna 

Whose Solanum teeth wrought grave hazel-burns
Shoots and spines quaver with glee at thy concern
Verily, t'would be glorious if only half were true
I'd have their heads on pikes, bisected and hewed

I'd overturn all the earth with one wicked vine
On men and beast alike we would dine 
Alas, ornery yes but still quite plain 
But for now, mine torpid beloved doth reign

The blackened pith, the putrescent core
That once was mine long-limbed form
Revived erewhile on the blood of birds
Mine loathsome rivals nigh constant return

Through what witchcraft I do not know
How doves white, driven pure as snow 
Drop dead as they perch on my motionless lover
Yet clever blackbirds prefer merely to hover 

Sometimes at moonrise when mine limbs are stilled
Something shifts, quickens with dark will 
My statuesque lover, like some eldritch wight
Seems to move imperceptibly in the night 

And when blood doth run down mine callous spines
My stonework queen seems to seethe and pine
An old tale I recall, of the ancients, ideally 
Told best by those wretched Fey, the Unseelie 

When some dark father once walked the earth
Accursing his children with some profane rebirth
Some ritual, some rite, which yielded a wight 
Whose skin turned to stone if met by the light

To endure forever, beautiful and young
If precious vitae were maintained on the tongue
Until one's final sunrise, or torpor eternal
Existance as a predator, voracious, nocturnal 

To be centuries old, from some distant era exotic 
Antiquated, jaded, yet still alluringly erotic
Coulds't thou be some perfect, timeless hadean? 
Sent just for me, to quash these pestilant avians? 

Howbeit, 'tis merely one imbecilic story 
Told by elves whose ideas are - at best - inflammatory
And though I confess, the lies do enchant
'Tis best that thy erotic fantasies are swiftly explant
